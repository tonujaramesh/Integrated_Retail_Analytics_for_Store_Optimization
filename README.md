# Integrated_Retail_Analytics_for_Store_Optimization
This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning to retail sales data from multiple stores. By integrating store attributes, promotions, and external factors (temperature, fuel price, CPI, unemployment), it predicts weekly sales, uncovers trends, and provides insights for store optimization.
